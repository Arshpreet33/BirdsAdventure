## General info
This app "Birds Adventure App" will be a handy application and keep track of the species we see in the field, their habitat, and irrespective of the internet. This way the users will have the best knowledge on birds, the music of the birds, pictures, videos, and the location of where the birds are located. It is easy to use a birding app, where a user can have his own personal space to upload the new information on birds, and can explore the plethora of birds and birdâ€™s information. Sometimes, it's tricky to identify the name of the flying bird. For example, Falcons, Eagles, Raptors are much alike and difficult to recognize, in this case, we can search for a name and get the results for the specific bird and compare it with the bird we see and get the information of the bird within the app. In addition, if the feature "Features Bird" is turned on, the app sends the notification to users whenever the users pass through the locations(specified in the app with regional birds)and can be turned off. However, irrespective of the feature, Users will still get the notifications if the user marked the listing bird to his favorites.
